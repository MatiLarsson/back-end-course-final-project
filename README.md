# Final Project for Coderhouse's Back-End course

The project consists of an ecommerce for a Beer Store.

It allows users to:

1. Register using their email or their Github account. They are asked to choose between multiple avatars offered by the store. If none is selected, the server will automatically assign a default avatar to the registered user.
2. Login using their pre-registered email and password or their Github account. The server will set a new session for the logging user.
3. Navigate through the store and pop up modals to get detailed information on every product.
4. Add to cart the desired products at any time.
5. View a summary of what is in cart by clicking on the cart widget located at the navbar.
6. Edit the desired quantities, delete any product, or empty the cart completely, directly inside the cart widget's modal.
7. When ready to submit the order, do so by clicking on the confirm order button located in the cart widget modal.
8. After confirmation, an email gets automatically dispatched to the user's pre-registered address with a small summary of the order submitted.
9. At any time, the user's session can be terminated by clicking on the logout button.

It allows admins to:

1. Register using their email. As a way to ease the process of navigating and testing out this demo, an input box has been implemented to allow visitors to register as an admin.
2. After registering as admin users, upon login the server will automatically redirect the user to the admin's control panel view.
3. Once in the admin's control panel view
